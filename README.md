# mailAppFrontend
Task 6 from the internship in Itransition:
Create a Web application without registration and authentication. 
At the start user have to enter its name (just name without password or anything).
After entering its name user get to the “send a message” form: recipient, title and the message body.
Recipient field should support autocompletion — when the user starts entering name, dropdown is shown with the corresponding names (you have to use ready component for this).
Body field  is multiline text (textarea).
